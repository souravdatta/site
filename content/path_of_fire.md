Trees may stand in your way

Dense, large â€“ however they sway

Not the shadow, neither a leaf

You may desire,

Behold, yours is the path of fire.





Never be tired and hide,

Never stop your stride,

Never turn back to the past,

Promise, it will never be the same,

Because, yours is the path of flame.





Before you, lay the earth

Where humans walk in pain and dearth

Muddled in tears, sweat and blood,

Struggling into the dark they graze,

Alas, yours is the path of blaze.




_[Translated from 'Agnipath' - hindi poem by Harivansh Rai Bachchan_]
